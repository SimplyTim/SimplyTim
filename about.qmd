Hey! My name is Timothy, but you can just call me Tim.
I am currently a graduate student at UBC from Trinidad and Tobago. I am 26 years old and I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science that I got from the University of the West Indies in 2021.

I enjoy video games, running, badminton and playing guitar. I am excited to learn more in the upcoming weeks about Data Science and making my own website using GitHub pages!
